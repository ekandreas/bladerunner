WordPress plugin for Blade L5 templating

== Description ==
Laravel Blade templating language for WordPress templates.
Uses the latest v5.4 of Laravel templating engine.

Read more about the language syntax at the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/blade)!

To grab the latest WordPress distro, go to [Bladerunner](http://bladerunner.elseif.se)!

All issues are managed at the [Github repo](https://github.com/ekandreas/bladerunner).

== Installation ==
To install it to your Composer based WordPress installation:

```
composer require ekandreas/bladerunner
```
Activate the plugin inside WordPress and templates with *.blade.php are inspected and active.
Your theme still needs an index.php due to WordPress basic functionality. When removed the theme is known as broken.

If you don\'t use a composer based WordPress development environment you can download the latest distributed plugin at [Bladerunner site](http://bladerunner.elseif.se), download and install it the common way with zip upload to WordPress via wp-admin.
